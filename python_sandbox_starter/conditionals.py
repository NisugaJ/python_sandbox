# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

x = 12

# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values
# if x > y:
#     print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')
# elif x == y:
#     print(f'{x} equals to {y}')
# else:
#     print(f'{y} is greater than {x}')

# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements
# if type(x) == int and type(y) == int:
#     print("Both x and y are integers")


# Membership Operators (in, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object




# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if(x in numbers):
    print(f'x exists in numbers')
